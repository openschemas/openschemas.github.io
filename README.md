# OpenSchemas Site

Hi friend! This site is the home of the Open Schemas specifications.
It is deployed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) at [openschemas.github.io](https://openschemas.github.io)

This repository is **not** where you contribute specification files that are rendered at 
[openschemas.github.io/specifications](https://openschemas.github.io/specifications/). If you want to
update or contribute a file, you want the [specifications repository](https://www.github.com/openschemas/specifications).
This repository should be used to develop the base templating for the site.
